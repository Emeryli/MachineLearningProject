## Machine Learning Project - Math Score Prediction
After being trained and tuned with sample data, this model is able to predict the students' math scores based on other factors such as gender, ethnicity, reading and writing scores with a impressive  coefficient of determination score of `RÂ²=88%`, representing the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (target) that is predictable from the independent variables.
